Problem:
    The Redis-server fails to save his changes, which causes him to crash.

Resolution:
    1. While the Redis-server is running, open a separate WSL-window.
    2. Type in:
            redis-cli
    3. Type in:
            CONFIG SET dir '/mnt/c/Users/lasse/downloads'
            CONFIG SET dbfilename temp.rdb
            BGSAVE
        where 'lasse' is to be replaced with your username
