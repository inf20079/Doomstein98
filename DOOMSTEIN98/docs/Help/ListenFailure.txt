Problem: Server starts with exception:
    Listen failure: Couldn't listen on 127.0.0.1:8000: [WinError 10048] Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.

Resolution:
    1. Open a terminal
    2. Get the currently active job on this port with
            netstat -ano|findstr 8000
        This should return lines like
            TCP    127.0.0.1:8000         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       33812
    3. Copy the PID (in this case 33812) and run
            taskkill /F /PID 33812
        with that PID
